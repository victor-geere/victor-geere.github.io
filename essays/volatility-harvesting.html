  <h2 id="section-1">1. Abstract</h2>
  <p>This paper explores the concept of volatility pumping in a discrete-time framework inspired by Luenberger (1998). It argues that rebalancing to constant weights allows investors to benefit from volatility through contrarian trading, but only under specific conditions involving excess volatility and mean reversion.</p>

  <h3 id="section-1-1">1.1 Key Intuition</h3>
  <p>The introductory paragraph highlights that rebalanced portfolios trade against past returns, buying low and selling high during price cycles.</p>

  <h4 id="section-1-1-1">1.1.1 Volatility Pumping Overview</h4>
  <p>In models like geometric Brownian motion, rebalanced portfolios grow even if the underlying asset does not, as shown in Luenberger's example.</p>
  <p>This concept, often termed volatility pumping or noise harvesting, suggests that by periodically rebalancing a portfolio to maintain fixed proportions between assets (such as a risky asset and cash), investors can generate positive returns purely from the volatility of the asset prices, without requiring any overall upward trend in the assets themselves. The mechanism relies on the mathematical property that the geometric mean of returns is less than the arithmetic mean due to volatility drag, but rebalancing counteracts this by capturing gains from fluctuations.</p>

  <h4 id="section-1-1-2">1.1.2 Role of Mean Reversion</h4>
  <p>The paper demonstrates that for expected relative returns to improve, prices must exhibit excess volatility, and mean reversion is essential for volatility pumping to benefit investors.</p>
  <p>Mean reversion refers to the tendency of asset prices to return to their long-term average after deviations, creating cycles that rebalancing can exploit. Without this, in purely random walk scenarios, the benefits are only asymptotic and not practically harvestable in finite time horizons, as the strategy does not systematically buy low and sell high but relies on fortuitous reversals.</p>

  <h3 id="section-1-2">1.2 Contributions</h3>
  <p>Analytical proofs show that in i.i.d. returns, rebalanced portfolios underperform buy-and-hold in expectation, with benefits being risk-based and asymptotic.</p>

  <h2 id="section-2">2. Introduction</h2>
  <p>The introduction sets the stage by discussing how constant-weight portfolios engage in contrarian trading, harvesting profits from price cycles.</p>

  <h3 id="section-2-1">2.1 Background on Rebalancing</h3>
  <p>Rebalancing maintains constant exposure, trading against recent performance.</p>

  <h4 id="section-2-1-1">2.1.1 Contrarian Trading</h4>
  <p>Buy underperformers and sell outperformers to exploit cycles.</p>
  <p>Contrarian trading is a strategy that goes against prevailing market trends by purchasing assets that have recently underperformed (and thus may be undervalued) and selling those that have outperformed (potentially overvalued). In the context of rebalancing, this occurs automatically as the portfolio adjusts weights back to targets, effectively selling winners to buy losers, which can profit from subsequent mean reversion in prices.</p>

  <h4 id="section-2-1-2">2.1.2 Luenberger's Example</h4>
  <p>In Luenberger (1998), a rebalanced portfolio between cash and a risky asset grows despite no growth in the risky asset.</p>
  <p>Luenberger's illustrative example uses a geometric Brownian motion model where the expected log-return of the risky asset is zero, meaning it has no long-term growth, yet a constantly rebalanced portfolio combining it with cash achieves positive growth over time. This counterintuitive result is attributed to the rebalancing capturing volatility, but the paper scrutinizes this to show it's not from pure randomness but subtle dynamics.</p>

  <h3 id="section-2-2">2.2 Excess Growth-Rate Concept</h3>
  <p>From Stochastic Portfolio Theory (Fernholz, 2002), excess growth-rate measures the gap between portfolio log-return and weighted asset log-returns.</p>

  <h2 id="section-3">3. Explanation</h2>
  <p>The paper "Harvesting Excess Volatility" by Guillaume Rabault delves into the mechanics of volatility pumping, a strategy where investors rebalance portfolios to constant weights to potentially benefit from asset price fluctuations. Drawing from Luenberger's 1998 model, it examines how rebalancing induces contrarian trading—buying assets after declines and selling after rises—allowing profits from price cycles. However, in scenarios with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) returns, the rebalanced portfolio underperforms its buy-and-hold counterpart in expected value, as the strategy loses money on average due to positive asset drift and zero expected cross-correlations. The benefits are primarily risk-based, with asymptotic outperformance almost surely, but this is fortuitous and akin to recurrence in random walks rather than true mean reversion. The analysis uses decompositions of relative returns and excess growth-rates to reveal hidden temporal correlations, emphasizing that pure randomness does not suffice for gains.</p>

  <p>To make volatility pumping viable for investors, the paper argues for the necessity of excess volatility, where long-term variance is less than scaled short-term variance, implying mean reversion. Analytical propositions show that monotonic price paths favor buy-and-hold, while cycles with local extrema benefit rebalancing. Simulations in i.i.d. settings confirm negative expected profits but positive asymptotic log-ratios, with finite-horizon probabilities of outperformance increasing slowly. Introducing mean reversion via an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process significantly improves expected outcomes, turning the strategy into one that covaried positions with prospective returns for wealth growth. Overall, the work clarifies that rebalancing's advantages require time-varying investment opportunities and cautions against overinterpreting asymptotic results, comparing them to the Saint Petersburg paradox, while relating to broader literature in stochastic portfolio theory.</p>

  <h3 id="section-3-1">3.1 Overall Summary Paragraphs</h3>
  <p>This subsection provides a high-level overview of the entire paper through concise paragraphs, capturing the core arguments, analytical insights, and conclusions without delving into technical details, serving as a quick reference for readers to grasp the paper's essence before exploring specific sections.</p>

  <h2 id="section-4">4. Relationship to the Literature</h2>
  <p>This section reviews applied literature on volatility pumping and rebalancing, noting conceptual ambiguities and unsubstantiated claims.</p>

  <h3 id="section-4-1">4.1 Applied Literature Overview</h3>
  <p>References include Bouchey (2015) and others, linking to excess growth-rate but emphasizing comparisons with buy-and-hold.</p>

  <h4 id="section-4-1-1">4.1.1 Common Claims and Criticisms</h4>
  <p>Concepts like volatility harvesting are often poorly delineated (e.g., Hallerbach, 2014).</p>
  <p>Many applied works claim that rebalancing generates "free" returns from volatility alone, but these assertions are criticized for lacking rigorous substantiation, often confusing diversification benefits with true volatility harvesting, and failing to account for the role of temporal dependencies in returns, leading to overstated practical advantages.</p>

  <h4 id="section-4-1-2">4.1.2 Stochastic Portfolio Theory</h4>
  <p>Fernholz (2002) centers on excess growth-rate, but it's not a direct payoff; benefits come from relative rebalancing frequencies.</p>
  <p>Stochastic Portfolio Theory provides a mathematical framework for analyzing portfolio performance relative to the market, introducing the excess growth-rate as a measure of outperformance due to diversification and rebalancing, but the current paper points out that this rate itself isn't harvestable in isolation and requires comparing different portfolio strategies to realize benefits.</p>

  <h3 id="section-4-2">4.2 Key Decompositions</h3>
  <p>The paper proposes decompositions revealing time correlations' role.</p>

  <h2 id="section-5">5. Setup and Notation</h2>
  <p>Assumes one risky asset with price \( (p_t)_{t \in \mathbb{N}} \), cash at zero rate, \( p_0 = 1 \).</p>

  <h3 id="section-5-1">5.1 Model Assumptions</h3>
  <p>Can interpret as two risky assets with one as numeraire (Pal, 2016).</p>

  <h4 id="section-5-1-1">5.1.1 Risky Asset and Cash</h4>
  <p>Return: \( R_{t+1} = 1 + r_{t+1} = \frac{p_{t+1}}{p_t} \).</p>
  <p>The model features a single risky asset whose price evolves over discrete time steps, paired with a risk-free cash account yielding zero interest, simplifying the analysis to focus on volatility effects without confounding factors like interest rates or multiple risky assets' interactions.</p>

  <h4 id="section-5-1-2">5.1.2 Returns and Log-Returns</h4>
  <p>Log-return: \( \log(1 + r_{t+1}) \).</p>
  <div class="formula-explanation">Where \( r_{t+1} \) is the simple return, and \( p_t \) is the price at time t.</div>
  <p>Log-returns are used for their additive property over time, facilitating analysis of compounding effects and asymptotic growth, while simple returns describe period-to-period changes, allowing the paper to bridge arithmetic and geometric perspectives on portfolio performance.</p>

  <h3 id="section-5-2">5.2 Buy-and-Hold vs. Rebalanced Portfolios</h3>
  <p>Buy-and-hold keeps shares fixed; rebalancing adjusts to constant exposure \( \pi \).</p>

  <h2 id="section-6">6. Analytical Results</h2>
  <p>Derives payoffs of rebalancing vs. buy-and-hold.</p>

  <h3 id="section-6-1">6.1 Compounding Returns</h3>
  <p>Defines function \( X(r_1, \dots, r_T) = \sum_{i<j} r_i r_j + \ higher\ terms \).</p>

  <h4 id="section-6-1-1">6.1.1 Relative Value Proposition</h4>
  <p>Proposition 1: \( V_{\pi, T} - W_{\pi, T} = \pi X(\pi r_1, \dots) - \pi X(r_1, \dots) \).</p>
  <div class="formula-explanation">Where \( V_{\pi, T} \) is rebalanced portfolio value, \( W_{\pi, T} \) is buy-and-hold value, \( \pi \) is target exposure, \( r_i \) are returns.</div>
  <p>This proposition expresses the difference in terminal values between rebalanced and buy-and-hold portfolios as a function of cross-products of returns, highlighting how rebalancing profits arise from interactions between sequential returns rather than isolated periods.</p>

  <h4 id="section-6-1-2">6.1.2 Second-Order Approximation</h4>
  <p>\( V_{\pi, T} - W_{\pi, T} \approx (\pi^2 - \pi) \sum_{i=1}^{T-1} r_i (\sum_{j=i+1}^T r_j) \).</p>
  <div class="formula-explanation">This approximation highlights cross-products of returns, where gains occur if signs alternate (local extrema).</div>
  <p>The second-order approximation simplifies the exact expression to focus on pairwise products of past returns with future cumulative returns, revealing that positive rebalancing gains require negative correlations between these terms, which occur at local price peaks or troughs in the trajectory.</p>

  <h3 id="section-6-2">6.2 Excess Growth-Rate Arithmetic</h3>
  <p>Log-returns: \( \log(1 + \pi r) = \pi \log(1 + r) + \gamma_\pi^*(r) \), with \( \gamma_\pi^* > 0 \).</p>
  <div class="formula-explanation">Where \( \gamma_\pi^* \) is the excess growth-rate term, positive due to log concavity.</div>

  <h2 id="section-7">7. The Ex-Ante View</h2>
  <p>Shifts to probabilistic perspective, focusing on i.i.d. returns.</p>

  <h3 id="section-7-1">7.1 I.I.D. Returns Case</h3>
  <p>Expected return \( \mu > 0 \), variance \( \sigma^2 \).</p>

  <h4 id="section-7-1-1">7.1.1 Log-Optimal Policy</h4>
  <p>Maximizes \( E[\log(1 + \pi r)] \approx \pi \mu - \frac{1}{2} \pi^2 \sigma^2 \).</p>
  <div class="formula-explanation">Where \( \mu \) is expected return, \( \sigma \) is standard deviation; optimal \( \pi^* = \mu / \sigma^2 \).</div>
  <p>The log-optimal policy seeks to maximize the expected logarithmic return, which corresponds to maximizing long-term growth rate under repeated investments, leading to the Kelly criterion exposure that balances expected return against risk in an i.i.d. setting.</p>

  <h4 id="section-7-1-2">7.1.2 Asymptotic Performance</h4>
  <p>Rebalanced beats buy-and-hold asymptotically if \( \mu = 0.5 \sigma^2 \) (Luenberger case).</p>
  <p>In the long run, under conditions where the risky asset has zero asymptotic growth (drift equals half variance), the rebalanced portfolio outperforms buy-and-hold almost surely due to the cumulative excess growth-rate overpowering the divergence term, though this dominance is slow and not guaranteed in finite periods.</p>

  <h3 id="section-7-2">7.2 Risk-Return Trade-Off</h3>
  <p>Rebalancing controls risk but loses in expectation due to positive drift.</p>

  <h2 id="section-8">8. Simulations</h2>
  <p>Confirms analytical results with log-normal and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.</p>

  <h3 id="section-8-1">8.1 I.I.D. Case Results</h3>
  <p>For \( T=5 \), \( \sigma=0.16 \), rebalanced underperforms in expectation but positive log-ratio.</p>

  <h4 id="section-8-1-1">8.1.1 Finite Horizon Outcomes</h4>
  <p>Probability of outperformance increases with T but slowly.</p>
  <p>Over short to medium horizons, simulations show that while the expected value difference is negative, the probability that the rebalanced portfolio beats buy-and-hold grows with time, but the convergence to asymptotic certainty is gradual, limiting practical utility without infinite patience.</p>

  <h4 id="section-8-1-2">8.1.2 Gamma Distribution Approximation</h4>
  <p>Excess growth approximates Gamma distributions for divergence analysis.</p>
  <p>By approximating the excess growth-rate terms with quadratic functions, the distribution of normalized differences follows Gamma laws, allowing analytical insights into why expected log-ratios are positive despite negative expected value differences, due to the skewness and variance properties of these distributions.</p>

  <h3 id="section-8-2">8.2 Mean-Reversion via OU Process</h3>
  <p>With mean-reversion parameter \( \rho \), expected outperformance increases, confirming need for excess volatility.</p>

  <h2 id="section-9">9. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Summarizes that volatility pumping requires mean reversion for practical benefits, not just i.i.d. randomness.</p>

  <h3 id="section-9-1">9.1 Main Findings</h3>
  <p>Rebalancing benefits are risk-based in i.i.d., but mean reversion enables return enhancement.</p>

  <h4 id="section-9-1-1">9.1.1 Need for Excess Volatility</h4>
  <p>Cross-products of returns hide temporal correlations necessary for gains.</p>
  <p>Excess volatility, where long-run variability is lower than implied by short-run fluctuations, arises from negative autocorrelations (mean reversion), enabling the positive excess growth-rate to dominate the negative divergence term in finite times, thus making rebalancing profitable in expectation.</p>

  <h4 id="section-9-1-2">9.1.2 Practical Implications</h4>
  <p>Asymptotic results like in Luenberger are fortuitous, akin to Saint Petersburg paradox.</p>
  <p>The paper warns that relying on asymptotic outperformance in i.i.d. models is impractical, as it mirrors paradoxes where expected values diverge from almost-sure outcomes, advising investors to seek environments with genuine mean reversion for reliable volatility harvesting rather than gambling on long-run randomness.</p>

  <h3 id="section-9-2">9.2 Future Directions</h3>
  <p>Explore non-i.i.d. models further for real-world applications.</p>
