<!-- Section 1: Introduction -->
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
  The Riemann zeta function, denoted \( \zeta(s) \), is a cornerstone of analytic number theory, celebrated for its deep connections to the distribution of prime numbers. Defined initially for complex numbers \( s \) with real part greater than 1 as
  \[ \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}, \]
  it extends beyond this domain through various representations, including integrals that offer profound insights into its properties.
</p>
<p>
  This ebook explores how the integrals of two functions, \( f(x,s) \) and \( g(x,s) \), relate to both the Riemann zeta function \( \zeta(s) \) and the Riemann Xi function \( \xi(s) \). By examining these relationships, we aim to illuminate the structure of these functions and their significance in mathematics.
</p>

<!-- Section 2: Integral Representation of the Zeta Function -->
<h2 id="zeta-integral">2. Integral Representation of the Zeta Function</h2>
<p>
  One of the most powerful tools for studying the zeta function is its integral representation involving the Gamma function \( \Gamma(s) \). For \( \text{Re}(s) > 1 \), we have:
  \[ \Gamma(s) \zeta(s) = \int_0^\infty \frac{x^{s - 1}}{e^x - 1} \, dx. \]
  This integral converges in the specified region and provides a pathway to analytically continue \( \zeta(s) \) across the complex plane.
</p>
<p>
  The integrand, \( \frac{x^{s - 1}}{e^x - 1} \), is complex-valued when \( s \) is complex, blending real and imaginary components that reflect the behavior of \( \zeta(s) \). Our goal is to decompose this integrand using \( f(x,s) \) and \( g(x,s) \) to uncover their connections to \( \zeta(s) \).
</p>

<!-- Section 3: Defining f(x,s) and g(x,s) -->
<h2 id="functions-f-g">3. Defining \( f(x,s) \) and \( g(x,s) \)</h2>
<p>
  To bridge the integral representation to \( \zeta(s) \), we introduce the functions \( f(x,s) \) and \( g(x,s) \), defined in terms of the integrand and its conjugate. For complex constants \( a \) and \( b \), they are given by:
  \[ f(x, s) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ (a + b i) \frac{x^{s - 1}}{e^x - 1} + (a - b i) \frac{x^{\overline{s} - 1}}{e^x - 1} \right], \]
  \[ g(x, s) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ (b - a i) \frac{x^{s - 1}}{e^x - 1} + (b + a i) \frac{x^{\overline{s} - 1}}{e^x - 1} \right], \]
  where \( \overline{s} \) is the complex conjugate of \( s \).
</p>
<p>
  A particularly insightful case arises when \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 0 \):
  \[ f(x, s) = \text{Re}\left( \frac{x^{s - 1}}{e^x - 1} \right), \]
  \[ g(x, s) = \text{Im}\left( \frac{x^{s - 1}}{e^x - 1} \right). \]
  Here, \( f(x,s) \) and \( g(x,s) \) represent the real and imaginary parts of the integrand, respectively, simplifying our analysis of their integrals.
</p>

<!-- Section 4: Integrals of f(x,s) and g(x,s) and ζ(s) -->
<h2 id="zeta-relationship">4. Integrals of \( f(x,s) \) and \( g(x,s) \) and \( \zeta(s) \)</h2>
<p>
  Integrating \( f(x,s) \) and \( g(x,s) \) from 0 to \( \infty \) reveals their relationship to \( \zeta(s) \). With \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 0 \), we compute:
  \[ \int_0^\infty f(x, s) \, dx + i \int_0^\infty g(x, s) \, dx = \int_0^\infty \frac{x^{s - 1}}{e^x - 1} \, dx = \Gamma(s) \zeta(s). \]
  Since \( f(x,s) \) and \( g(x,s) \) are real-valued, this splits into:
  \[ \int_0^\infty f(x, s) \, dx = \text{Re}(\Gamma(s) \zeta(s)), \]
  \[ \int_0^\infty g(x, s) \, dx = \text{Im}(\Gamma(s) \zeta(s)). \]
</p>
<p>
  When \( s \) is real and greater than 1, \( \Gamma(s) \zeta(s) \) is real, implying \( \int_0^\infty g(x, s) \, dx = 0 \), and the integral of \( f(x,s) \) fully accounts for \( \Gamma(s) \zeta(s) \). For general \( a \) and \( b \), the relationship becomes:
  \[ \int_0^\infty f(x, s) \, dx + i \int_0^\infty g(x, s) \, dx = (a + b i) \Gamma(s) \zeta(s), \]
  offering a versatile framework for connecting these integrals to the zeta function.
</p>

<!-- Section 5: The Riemann Xi Function -->
<h2 id="xi-function">5. The Riemann Xi Function</h2>
<p>
  The Riemann Xi function, \( \xi(s) \), is an entire function tied to \( \zeta(s) \) via the relation:
  \[ \xi(s) = \frac{1}{2} s (s - 1) \pi^{-s/2} \Gamma\left( \frac{s}{2} \right) \zeta(s). \]
  Its symmetry, \( \xi(s) = \xi(1 - s) \), and the fact that its zeros align with the non-trivial zeros of \( \zeta(s) \) make it a key object in number theory.
</p>
<p>
  Since \( \xi(s) \) incorporates \( \zeta(s) \), we can extend our integral relationships to express \( \xi(s) \) in terms of \( f(x,s) \) and \( g(x,s) \), deepening our understanding of both functions.
</p>

<!-- Section 6: Relating ξ(s) to f(x,s) and g(x,s) -->
<h2 id="xi-relationship">6. Relating \( \xi(s) \) to \( f(x,s) \) and \( g(x,s) \)</h2>
<p>
  Using the integral relationship for \( \zeta(s) \), we start with:
  \[ \Gamma(s) \zeta(s) = \int_0^\infty f(x, s) \, dx + i \int_0^\infty g(x, s) \, dx. \]
  Solving for \( \zeta(s) \):
  \[ \zeta(s) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)} \left( \int_0^\infty f(x, s) \, dx + i \int_0^\infty g(x, s) \, dx \right). \]
  Substituting into the definition of \( \xi(s) \):
  \[ \xi(s) = \frac{1}{2} s (s - 1) \pi^{-s/2} \Gamma\left( \frac{s}{2} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)} \left( \int_0^\infty f(x, s) \, dx + i \int_0^\infty g(x, s) \, dx \right). \]
</p>
<p>
  This expression links \( \xi(s) \) directly to the integrals of \( f(x,s) \) and \( g(x,s) \), modulated by the factor \( \frac{1}{2} s (s - 1) \pi^{-s/2} \frac{\Gamma\left( \frac{s}{2} \right)}{\Gamma(s)} \). It demonstrates how these integrals underpin both \( \zeta(s) \) and \( \xi(s) \), offering a unified analytical perspective.
</p>

<p>
  The expanded version is \[
  \xi(s) = \frac{1}{2} s (s - 1) \pi^{-s/2} \Gamma\left( \frac{s}{2} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)} \left( \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{2} \left[ (a + b i) \frac{x^{s - 1}}{e^x - 1} + (a - b i) \frac{x^{\overline{s} - 1}}{e^x - 1} \right] \, dx + i \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{2} \left[ (b - a i) \frac{x^{s - 1}}{e^x - 1} + (b + a i) \frac{x^{\overline{s} - 1}}{e^x - 1} \right] \, dx \right)
  \]
</p>

<!-- Section 7: Conclusion -->
<h2 id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  This ebook has elucidated the relationships between the integrals of \( f(x,s) \) and \( g(x,s) \) and the Riemann zeta function \( \zeta(s) \) and Xi function \( \xi(s) \). By constructing \( f(x,s) \) and \( g(x,s) \) from the zeta function’s integral representation, we’ve shown how their integrals reconstruct \( \Gamma(s) \zeta(s) \) and, by extension, express \( \xi(s) \).
</p>
<p>
  These connections highlight the elegance of integral methods in number theory and suggest further avenues for exploration, such as analyzing these integrals’ behavior across the complex plane or their implications for the zeros of \( \zeta(s) \) and \( \xi(s) \). The interplay of \( f(x,s) \) and \( g(x,s) \) with these classic functions underscores their mathematical richness.
