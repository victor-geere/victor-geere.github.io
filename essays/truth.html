        <h2>Rigour</h2>
        <p>
            Rigour refers to a process of adhering absolutely to certain constraints. It is the practice of
            maintaining strict consistency with certain predefined parameters. The mathematical definitions of
            conjecture, proof and theorem are used i.e. a conjecture withstood the scrutiny of existing knowledge,
            a proof is unfalsifiable, a theorem has been proven and a law defines the boundaries of the environment and is beyond
            scrutiny. This is in contrast to their scientific counterparts. Additionally,
            a truth is a multidisciplinary abstraction that has remained standing in the face of the aforementioned. The application of
            a theorem or a truth is itself subject to rigour.

        <h2>Intellectual Rigour</h2>
        <p>
            Intellectual rigour is a process of thought which is consistent, does not contain self-contradiction, and
            takes into account the entire scope of available knowledge on the topic. It actively avoids logical fallacy.
            Furthermore, it requires a sceptical assessment of the available knowledge. If a topic or case is dealt with
            in a rigorous way, it typically means that it is dealt with in a comprehensive, thorough and complete way,
            leaving no room for inconsistencies.

        <h2>Mathematical Proof</h2>
        <p>
            A mathematical proof is an inferential argument for a mathematical statement, showing that the stated
            assumptions logically guarantee the conclusion. The argument may use other previously established
            statements, such as theorems; but every proof can, in principle, be constructed using only certain basic or
            original assumptions known as axioms, along with the accepted rules of inference. Proofs are
            examples of exhaustive deductive reasoning which establish logical certainty, to be distinguished from
            empirical arguments or non-exhaustive inductive reasoning which establish "reasonable expectation".

        <h2>Practical Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            Where it is impossible to consider all the possible values of all the variables that are or might become
            relevant
            in future it is useful to consider the variables at their limits. Limits are not necessarily encountered at
            the extremities as periodic functions might encounter their limits at regular intervals. Timelines might
            never reach their extremities as an infinite timeline is not a practical consideration. The application of
            practical considerations should in itself be subjected to rigour. Where practical considerations limit
            provability, the practical application of the theorem should be limited by the same measure.

        <h2>Scrutinizing and defending a conjecture</h2>
        <p>
            A criticism should not be thought of as an opposition to truth but forms part of the body of knowledge. The
            critical argument should itself be scrutinised separate from the conjecture. If it is a theorem or truth
            itself, it must be considered as part of the conjecture under the maxim of Total Evidence. The conjecture is then
            scrutinised again with the newly introduced knowledge included. If the original conjecture remains unchanged for
            all values of the criticism, the criticism may be archived but noted as a non-determinant. If additional criticism is
            considered at a later stage, non-determinants should be inspected for interaction.
