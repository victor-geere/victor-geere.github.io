    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This text explores how a simple trigonometric function can help us identify the divisors of a number, linking it
        to deep concepts in number theory and complex analysis. We’ll focus on the function
    </p>
    <p>\[ y(x) = 2 - \cos(2\pi k x) - \cos(2\pi k / x) \]</p>
    <p> where \( k \) is a positive integer, and discover that its zeros occur exactly at the divisors of \( k \). Using
        tools from complex analysis—specifically contour integrals and residue theory—we’ll show how this function
        relates to a sum over these divisors, resembling the famous Riemann zeta function. Whether you’re new to these
        areas or looking to deepen your understanding, this journey will blend intuition with rigor to uncover a novel
        way to “detect” divisors, making abstract mathematics both accessible and exciting.</p>

<section id="intro-riemann">
    <h2>2. Introduction to the Riemann Zeta Function</h2>
    <p>The Riemann zeta function is a pivotal object in mathematics, bridging analysis and number theory through its
        elegant definitions and profound implications. This section introduces its basic form, historical significance,
        and key properties that make it a cornerstone of modern mathematics.</p>
    <p>Defined for complex numbers \( s \) with real part greater than 1, the Riemann zeta function is given by the
        infinite series:</p>
    <p>\[ \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} \]</p>
    <p>This series converges for \( \Re(s) > 1 \), but the function can be extended to the entire complex plane (except
        for a pole at \( s = 1 \)) via analytic continuation. One of its most striking features is the Euler
        product:</p>
    <p>\[ \zeta(s) = \prod_{p \text{ prime}} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p^s}\right)^{-1} \]</p>
    <p>This product over all prime numbers reveals the zeta function’s deep connection to the distribution of primes, a
        relationship explored by Bernhard Riemann in 1859. His hypothesis about the zeros of \( \zeta(s) \) remains one
        of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, underscoring the function’s enduring importance.</p>
</section>
<section id="divisors">
    <h2>3. Divisor Functions</h2>
    <p>Divisor functions offer a window into the structure of integers by quantifying their divisors in various ways.
        This section explores their definitions and their intriguing connections to the Riemann zeta function, laying
        the groundwork for understanding arithmetic properties.</p>
    <p>The simplest divisor function, \( d(n) \), counts the number of positive divisors of an integer \( n \). For
        example, for \( n = 6 \), the divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6, so \( d(6) = 4 \). Another key function is \(
        \sigma_k(n) \), the sum of the \( k \)-th powers of the divisors of \( n \):</p>
    <p>\[ \sigma_k(n) = \sum_{d|n} d^k \]</p>
    <p>When \( k = 0 \), \( \sigma_0(n) = d(n) \), and when \( k = 1 \), \( \sigma_1(n) \) is the sum of the divisors
        (e.g., \( \sigma_1(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12 \)). These functions are multiplicative, meaning if \( m \) and \( n
        \) are coprime, then \( \sigma_k(mn) = \sigma_k(m) \sigma_k(n) \). The zeta function relates to these via
        Dirichlet series, such as:</p>
    <p>\[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sigma_k(n)}{n^s} = \zeta(s) \zeta(s - k) \quad \text{for} \quad \Re(s) > \max(1, k +
        1) \]</p>
    <p>This identity highlights how divisor sums encode information that interacts with the zeta function, a theme
        likely central to discussions of zeta and divisors.</p>
</section>
<section id="mobius">
    <h2>4. The Möbius Function</h2>
    <p>The Möbius function is a fascinating tool in number theory, known for its role in inverting sums and its elegant
        relationship with the zeta function. This section defines the function, illustrates its properties, and explains
        its significance in mathematical transformations.</p>
    <p>The Möbius function \( \mu(n) \) is defined as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\( \mu(1) = 1 \),</li>
        <li>\( \mu(n) = (-1)^k \) if \( n \) is a square-free integer with \( k \) distinct prime factors,</li>
        <li>\( \mu(n) = 0 \) if \( n \) has a squared prime factor.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, \( \mu(1) = 1 \), \( \mu(2) = -1 \), \( \mu(4) = 0 \) (since \( 4 = 2^2 \)), \( \mu(6) = \mu(2 \cdot
        3) = (-1)^2 = 1 \), and \( \mu(12) = 0 \) (since \( 12 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \)). It’s multiplicative, so for coprime \(
        m \) and \( n \), \( \mu(mn) = \mu(m) \mu(n) \). A key property is its connection to the zeta function:</p>
    <p>\[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s} = \frac{1}{\zeta(s)} \quad \text{for} \quad \Re(s) > 1 \]</p>
    <p>This arises because the Euler product \( \zeta(s) = \prod_{p} (1 - p^{-s})^{-1} \) has a reciprocal \( \prod_{p}
        (1 - p^{-s}) \), which expands to the series with \( \mu(n) \). The Möbius inversion formula leverages this: if
        \( g(n) = \sum_{d|n} f(d) \), then:</p>
    <p>\[ f(n) = \sum_{d|n} \mu(d) g\left(\frac{n}{d}\right) \]</p>
    <p>This formula is essential for unraveling sums over divisors, making \( \mu(n) \) a powerful analytical tool.</p>
</section>

<section id="background">
    <h2>5. Background on Divisors and the Zeta Function</h2>
    <p>Let’s start with some foundational concepts that will anchor our exploration.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Divisors</strong>: A divisor of a positive integer \( k \) is any positive integer \( d \) such that
            \( k \div d \) is also an integer. For example, if \( k = 6 \), dividing 6 by 1, 2, 3, and 6 gives integers
            (6, 3, 2, 1), so the positive divisors are \( \{1, 2, 3, 6\} \). We denote this set as \( \text{Div}(k) \).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Divisor Function</strong>: This is a way to summarize information about divisors. Define \(
            \sigma_s(k) = \sum_{d|k} d^s \), where the sum is over all positive divisors of \( k \), and \( s \) is a
            number (real or complex). For \( s = 1 \), \( \sigma_1(6) = 1^1 + 2^1 + 3^1 + 6^1 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12 \).
            For \( s = 0 \), it’s just the number of divisors: \( \sigma_0(6) = 4 \). We’ll later use \( s \) as a
            negative number, like \( \sigma_{-s}(k) = \sum_{d|k} d^{-s} \).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Riemann Zeta Function</strong>: This function, \( \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-s} \) (for
            complex \( s \) where the real part \( \text{Re}(s) > 1 \)), sums over all positive integers and is key in
            studying prime numbers. Think of it as a grand tally that connects to how numbers factor into primes. We’ll
            draw parallels to a smaller sum over just the divisors of \( k \).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our goal is to link a trigonometric function to \( \sum_{d|k} d^{-s} \), a “divisor zeta function” that focuses
        on \( k \)’s divisors.</p>
</section>
<section id="function-y">
    <h2>6. The Function y(x) and Its Properties</h2>
    <p>Now, meet our star: \( y(x) = 2 - \cos(2\pi k x) - \cos(2\pi k / x) \), where \( k \) is a fixed positive
        integer, and \( x > 0 \) is a real number. This function oscillates due to the cosine terms, but it’s crafted to
        equal zero exactly when \( x \) is a divisor of \( k \).</p>
    <p>Why does this happen? Cosine equals 1 when its argument is a multiple of \( 2\pi \). If \( x = d \) and \( d \)
        divides \( k \), then:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\( k = d \cdot q \) for some integer \( q \).</li>
        <li>First term: \( 2\pi k x = 2\pi k d = 2\pi (d q) d = 2\pi q d^2 \), an integer times \( 2\pi \), so \(
            \cos(2\pi k d) = 1 \).
        </li>
        <li>Second term: \( 2\pi k / x = 2\pi k / d = 2\pi (d q) / d = 2\pi q \), also an integer times \( 2\pi \), so
            \( \cos(2\pi k / d) = 1 \).
        </li>
        <li>Thus, \( y(d) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0 \).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let’s test \( k = 6 \):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\( x = 1 \): \( y(1) = 2 - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 \cdot 1) - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 / 1) = 2 - \cos(12\pi) -
            \cos(12\pi) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0 \).
        </li>
        <li>\( x = 2 \): \( y(2) = 2 - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 \cdot 2) - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 / 2) = 2 - \cos(24\pi) -
            \cos(6\pi) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0 \).
        </li>
        <li>\( x = 3 \), \( x = 6 \): Similarly, both give 0.</li>
        <li>\( x = 4 \): \( y(4) = 2 - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 \cdot 4) - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 / 4) = 2 - \cos(48\pi) -
            \cos(3\pi) = 2 - 1 - (-1) = 2 > 0 \), not a divisor.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, \( y(x) = 0 \) only at \( x = 1, 2, 3, 6 \), the divisors of 6. Elsewhere, \( y(x) > 0 \) because the cosines
        don’t align to subtract fully to 2.</p>
</section>
<section id="zeros">
    <h2>7. Zeros of y(x) and Their Significance</h2>
    <p>We’ve seen \( y(x) \) zeros out at divisors, but how “deep” are these zeros? Compute the derivative:</p>
    <p>\[ y'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} [2 - \cos(2\pi k x) - \cos(2\pi k / x)] = 2\pi k \sin(2\pi k x) + \frac{2\pi k}{x^2}
        \sin(2\pi k / x) \]</p>
    <p>At \( x = d \), a divisor:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\( \sin(2\pi k d) = \sin(\text{integer} \cdot 2\pi) = 0 \).</li>
        <li>\( \sin(2\pi k / d) = \sin(2\pi q) = 0 \).</li>
        <li>So, \( y'(d) = 0 \).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since \( y(d) = 0 \) and \( y'(d) = 0 \), each zero is at least double (like a parabola touching the x-axis). The
        second derivative:</p>
    <p>\[ y''(x) = (2\pi k)^2 \cos(2\pi k x) - \frac{4\pi k}{x^3} \sin(2\pi k / x) - \frac{(2\pi k)^2}{x^4} \cos(2\pi k
        / x) \]</p>
    <p>At \( x = d \), this simplifies to \( y''(d) = (2\pi k)^2 (1 - 1/d^4) \), which is positive for \( d > 1 \),
        confirming a double zero. This multiplicity will matter when we analyze \( y'(x)/y(x) \).</p>
</section>
<section id="contour-integrals">
    <h2>8. Contour Integrals and Residue Theory</h2>
    <p>Now we enter complex analysis. Extend \( y(x) \) to \( y(z) = 2 - \cos(2\pi k z) - \cos(2\pi k / z) \) for
        complex \( z \neq 0 \). It has zeros at \( z = d \) and \( z = -d \) for each divisor \( d \). The function \(
        \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} \) has poles at these zeros. Near a double zero \( z = d \), \( y(z) \approx c (z - d)^2 \),
        so:</p>
    <p>\[ y'(z) \approx 2c (z - d), \quad \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} \approx \frac{2c (z - d)}{c (z - d)^2} = \frac{2}{z - d}
        \]</p>
    <p>This has a simple pole at \( z = d \) with residue 2. The residue theorem says for a closed contour \( C \):</p>
    <p>\[ \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C f(z) \, dz = \text{sum of residues inside } C \]</p>
    <p>For \( f(z) = \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} z^{-s} \), each pole at \( z = d \) contributes residue \( 2 d^{-s} \).</p>
</section>
<section id="connecting">
    <h2>9. Connecting y(x) to the Divisor Zeta Function</h2>
    <p>Choose a contour \( C \) enclosing all positive divisors \( d \) (e.g., a curve along the real axis from \(
        \epsilon \) to a large \( R \), indented around zeros, and closed appropriately). The poles of \(
        \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} z^{-s} \) at \( z = d \) (positive \( d|k \)) give:</p>
    <p>\[ \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} z^{-s} \, dz = \sum_{d|k} 2 d^{-s} \]</p>
    <p>(Negative zeros are outside \( C \), and we assume other complex zeros don’t interfere, or their contribution
        cancels in a full contour.) This matches our target: \( 2 \sum_{d|k} d^{-s} \), a scaled divisor zeta function,
        linking \( y(x) \)’s zeros to \( k \)’s divisors analytically.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-it-works">
    <h2>10. How It Works: The Contour Integral Method</h2>
    <p>This chapter explores the contour integral method, a powerful technique that detects the divisors of a positive
        integer \( k \) without listing them explicitly. By using the function \( y(x) = 2 - \cos(2\pi k x) - \cos(2\pi
        k / x) \) and tools from complex analysis, we can compute a sum over these divisors, resembling the structure of
        the Riemann zeta function. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how this method works.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Understanding the Function \( y(x) \)</h3>
    <p>The function \( y(x) = 2 - \cos(2\pi k x) - \cos(2\pi k / x) \) is designed to equal zero exactly when \( x \) is
        a positive integer divisor of \( k \). For instance, if \( k = 6 \), the divisors are \( 1, 2, 3, 6 \). At these
        points:
    <ul>
        <li>\( y(1) = 2 - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 \cdot 1) - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 / 1) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0 \)</li>
        <li>\( y(2) = 2 - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 \cdot 2) - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 / 2) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0 \)</li>
    </ul>
    and similarly for \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 6 \). For all other \( x \), \( y(x) > 0 \), since the cosine terms don’t
    both reach 1 simultaneously.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Extending to the Complex Plane</h3>
    <p>To use complex analysis, we extend the function to \( y(z) = 2 - \cos(2\pi k z) - \cos(2\pi k / z) \), where \( z
        \) is a complex variable. This function has zeros at the positive divisors \( z = d \) and their negatives \( z
        = -d \), because \( y(-d) = y(d) = 0 \). There may also be other complex zeros, but we’ll choose our contour to
        focus only on the positive divisors.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: The Logarithmic Derivative \( \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} \)</h3>
    <p>The logarithmic derivative \( \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} \) helps us analyze the zeros. Near a zero \( z = d \), \( y(z)
        \) behaves like a quadratic, \( y(z) \approx c (z - d)^2 \) (indicating a double zero). Then:
        \[
        y'(z) \approx 2c (z - d), \quad \text{so} \quad \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} \approx \frac{2c (z - d)}{c (z - d)^2} =
        \frac{2}{z - d}
        \]
        This shows that \( \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} \) has a simple pole at \( z = d \) with residue 2, and similarly at \( z
        = -d \).</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Setting Up the Contour Integral</h3>
    <p>We define the contour integral:
        \[
        I(s) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} z^{-s} \, dz
        \]
        Here, \( C \) is a contour that encloses all positive divisors \( z = d > 0 \) (e.g., \( 1, 2, 3, 6 \) for \( k
        = 6 \)) but excludes the negative ones \( z = -d < 0 \). A suitable contour might be a semicircle in the right
        half-plane or a rectangle along the positive real axis.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Applying the Residue Theorem</h3>
    <p>Using the residue theorem, the integral equals the sum of the residues of \( \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} z^{-s} \) inside
        \( C \). The poles inside \( C \) are at the positive divisors \( z = d \), each with residue \( 2 \cdot d^{-s}
        \). Thus:
        \[
        I(s) = \sum_{d|k, \, d > 0} 2 d^{-s}
        \]
        Since all divisors of a positive integer \( k \) are positive, this is \( 2 \sum_{d|k} d^{-s} \), a scaled
        version of the divisor zeta function \( \sigma_{-s}(k) \).</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Handling Other Zeros</h3>
    <p>The function \( y(z) \) may have additional complex zeros, but we assume they lie outside \( C \) or their
        contributions cancel out (e.g., due to symmetry in a larger contour). The oscillatory behavior of \( y(z) \) is
        managed by carefully selecting \( C \) to avoid complications.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: The Final Result</h3>
    <p>The contour integral yields:
        \[
        \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} z^{-s} \, dz = 2 \sum_{d|k} d^{-s}
        \]
        This result lets us sum over the divisors of \( k \) analytically, using the zeros of \( y(z) \) and the residue
        theorem, without needing to identify the divisors beforehand. It connects number theory and complex analysis,
        much like the Riemann zeta function does for all integers.</p>

    <p><strong>Summary of the Method:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use \( y(z) \) to locate divisors via its zeros.</li>
        <li>Compute \( \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} \) to create poles at those zeros.</li>
        <li>Integrate \( \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} z^{-s} \) over a contour enclosing the positive divisors.</li>
        <li>Apply the residue theorem to get \( 2 \sum_{d|k} d^{-s} \).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This technique elegantly detects divisors and computes their arithmetic sum, highlighting the interplay between
        oscillatory functions and complex integration.</p>
</section>
<section id="practical-feasibility">
    <h2>11. Practical Feasibility of the Contour Integral Method</h2>
    <p>The contour integral method we’ve explored—computing \( \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} z^{-s} \, dz
        = 2 \sum_{d|k} d^{-s} \) with \( y(z) = 2 - \cos(2\pi k z) - \cos(2\pi k / z) \)—offers a fascinating
        theoretical link between oscillatory functions and the divisors of \( k \). But how feasible is it to implement
        this in practice, especially for tasks like detecting divisors or factoring integers? This section assesses its
        computational complexity and real-world applicability.</p>

    <h3>Objective and Theoretical Promise</h3>
    <p>The method aims to calculate a sum over the divisors of \( k \), \( 2 \sum_{d|k} d^{-s} \), without explicitly
        listing them. This sum resembles a Dirichlet series, akin to the Riemann zeta function, and leverages the zeros
        of \( y(z) \) to encode divisor information. Theoretically, this is elegant: it uses complex analysis to extract
        arithmetic properties of \( k \) in a single integral. But translating this into a practical algorithm reveals
        significant challenges.</p>

    <h3>Computational Complexity</h3>
    <p>Let’s break down the complexity of computing this integral numerically, as we don’t have a closed-form
        solution:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contour Discretization</strong>: To approximate the integral, we discretize the contour \( C \)
            (e.g., a circle or path enclosing the positive divisors) into \( N \) points. Each point requires evaluating
            the integrand \( \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} z^{-s} \).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Function Evaluation</strong>: For each \( z \):
            <ul>
                <li>Compute \( y(z) = 2 - \cos(2\pi k z) - \cos(2\pi k / z) \), involving complex trigonometric
                    functions.
                </li>
                <li>Approximate \( y'(z) \) numerically, e.g., via finite difference: \( y'(z) \approx \frac{y(z + h) -
                    y(z - h)}{2h} \), doubling the evaluations per point.
                </li>
                <li>Calculate \( z^{-s} \) and the full integrand.</li>
            </ul>
            Each evaluation is \( O(1) \) but involves complex arithmetic, which is computationally heavier than
            real-number operations.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Total Operations</strong>: With \( N \) points, the complexity is at least \( O(N) \). However, \( N
            \) must be large because \( y(z) \) oscillates rapidly as \( k \) increases, requiring a fine mesh to
            capture the poles accurately.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Scaling with \( k \)**: For larger \( k \), the number of divisors \( \tau(k) \) grows (typically \(
            O(\log k) \), but up to \( O(k^{1/2}) \) for highly composite numbers), and the oscillations in \( y(z) \)
            become more frequent. This suggests \( N \) may need to scale polynomially or worse with \( k \), making the
            method impractical for big numbers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In contrast, trial division to find divisors takes \( O(\sqrt{k}) \) time, and advanced methods like the
        quadratic sieve are subexponential. The contour integral’s complexity, likely exceeding \( O(k) \) due to \( N
        \), is far less efficient.</p>

    <h3>Practical Limitations</h3>
    <p>Beyond complexity, several practical hurdles emerge:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contour Selection</strong>: Without knowing the divisors, choosing \( C \) to enclose only \( z = d
            > 0 \) is guesswork. A contour too small misses divisors; too large includes unwanted poles (e.g., negative
            or complex zeros), skewing the result.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Numerical Precision</strong>: The rapid oscillations of \( y(z) \) for large \( k \) demand high
            precision, increasing computation time and memory use.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Output Interpretation</strong>: The integral yields \( 2 \sum_{d|k} d^{-s} \), a single number
            (e.g., for \( k = 6 \), \( s = 1 \), it’s \( 2(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6) = 4 \)). Extracting individual divisors
            or prime factors from this sum requires further processing, which this method doesn’t provide.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Does It Solve Integer Factorization?</h3>
    <p>Integer factorization seeks the prime factors of \( k \) (e.g., \( 15 = 3 \times 5 \)). While our method computes
        a sum over all divisors, it doesn’t isolate prime factors or list divisors efficiently. To factor \( k \), we’d
        need additional steps to decompose \( \sum_{d|k} d^{-s} \), which isn’t straightforward and negates the method’s
        purpose. Thus, it falls short of solving factorization.</p>

    <h3>Python Implementation Feasibility</h3>
    <p>Implementing this in Python is possible but impractical for large \( k \). A basic approach might:
    <ul>
        <li>Use <code>cmath</code> for complex numbers.</li>
        <li>Define \( y(z) \) and approximate \( y'(z) \).</li>
        <li>Numerically integrate over a circular contour.</li>
    </ul>
    For \( k = 6 \), with a small contour and many points, it might approximate \( 2 \sum_{d|k} d^{-1} = 4 \), but for
    \( k = 1000 \), the required \( N \) would balloon, slowing execution and risking numerical errors.</p>

    <h2>12. Applications and Examples</h2>
    <p>The concepts introduced—zeta function, divisor functions, and the Möbius function—find rich applications across
        number theory. This section showcases practical uses and examples that demonstrate their utility in solving
        mathematical problems.</p>
    <p>One application of Möbius inversion is computing the Euler totient function \( \phi(n) \), the count of integers
        up to \( n \) coprime to \( n \):</p>
    <p>\[ \phi(n) = n \sum_{d|n} \frac{\mu(d)}{d} \]</p>
    <p>For \( n = 6 \), divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6; so \( \phi(6) = 6 \left( \frac{\mu(1)}{1} + \frac{\mu(2)}{2} +
        \frac{\mu(3)}{3} + \frac{\mu(6)}{6} \right) = 6 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} \right) = 6
        \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 2 \), matching the coprimes 1 and 5. Another use is counting square-free integers up to \( x
        \), approximated by sums involving \( \mu(n) \). The zeta function’s role in the prime number theorem, linking
        \( \pi(x) \approx \frac{x}{\ln x} \) via its zeros, further exemplifies these connections.</p>
</section>


<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>13. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>We’ve built a bridge from a trigonometric function \( y(x) \) to the divisors of \( k \), showing its zeros
        pinpoint \( d|k \). Using complex analysis, we derived \( \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} z^{-s} \,
        dz = 2 \sum_{d|k} d^{-s} \), a powerful tool to detect divisors. This journey ties number theory to oscillatory
        behavior, offering both insight and a method to explore further.</p>
    <p>The contour integral method is a theoretical gem, linking oscillatory functions to divisor sums via complex
        analysis. However, its practical feasibility is limited by high computational complexity (\( O(N) \) with large
        \( N \)), contour ambiguity, and inability to directly yield prime factors. For detecting divisors or factoring
        integers, traditional algorithms vastly outperform it. Its value lies in mathematical insight, not computational
        utility.</p>

<section id="prompt">
    <h2>14. Re-Prompt</h2>

    <p class="code">
        Develop a mathematical method to detect the integer divisors of a given positive integer k by computing the sum
        Sum[d|k] d^(-s), where d are the positive divisors of k and s is a complex parameter, in a manner that resembles
        the structure of a Dirichlet series, such as the Riemann zeta function zeta(s) = Sum[n=1 to infinity] n^(-s).
        Use the function y(x) = 2 - cos(2 Pi k x) - cos(2 Pi k / x), which is known to equal zero exactly when x is an
        integer divisor of k (i.e., y(d) = 0 for d|k), as a key indicator of these divisors through its zeros. Your
        approach should:
        Analyze y(x): Confirm that y(x) = 0 only at x = d where d is a positive integer divisor of k, and explore the
        nature of these zeros (e.g., their multiplicity) by computing derivatives.

        Leverage Complex Analysis: Extend y(x) to a complex function y(z) and propose a contour integral involving
        y'(z)/y(z) or a similar logarithmic derivative, which has poles at the zeros of y(z), to extract information
        about the divisors.

        Connect to a Dirichlet Series: Design the integral so that its evaluation (e.g., via the residue theorem) yields
        a sum proportional to Sum[d|k] d^(-s), linking the zeros of y(x) to a zeta-like structure.

        Specify the Contour: Define a suitable contour in the complex plane that encloses the positive divisor zeros
        (e.g., z = d > 0) and justify its choice, addressing any challenges like oscillatory behavior or additional
        zeros.

        Interpret the Result: Explain how the final expression detects divisors and relates to the broader context of
        number theory, such as the zeta function’s role in encoding arithmetic properties.

        Provide a detailed derivation, including intermediate steps like computing residues, and conclude with a formula
        (e.g., a contour integral equaling 2 Sum[d|k] d^(-s)) that achieves this goal. Use examples (e.g., k = 6) to
        illustrate key points.
