    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This text explores how a simple trigonometric function can help us identify the divisors of a number, linking it
        to deep concepts in number theory and complex analysis. We’ll focus on the function
    </p>
    <p>\[ y(x) = 2 - \cos(2\pi k x) - \cos(2\pi k / x) \]</p>
    <p> where \( k \) is a positive integer, and discover that its zeros occur exactly at the divisors of \( k \). Using
        tools from complex analysis—specifically contour integrals and residue theory—we’ll show how this function
        relates to a sum over these divisors, resembling the famous Riemann zeta function. Whether you’re new to these
        areas or looking to deepen your understanding, this journey will blend intuition with rigor to uncover a novel
        way to “detect” divisors, making abstract mathematics both accessible and exciting.</p>
</section>
<section id="background">
    <h2>2. Background on Divisors and the Zeta Function</h2>
    <p>Let’s start with some foundational concepts that will anchor our exploration.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Divisors</strong>: A divisor of a positive integer \( k \) is any positive integer \( d \) such that
            \( k \div d \) is also an integer. For example, if \( k = 6 \), dividing 6 by 1, 2, 3, and 6 gives integers
            (6, 3, 2, 1), so the positive divisors are \( \{1, 2, 3, 6\} \). We denote this set as \( \text{Div}(k) \).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Divisor Function</strong>: This is a way to summarize information about divisors. Define \(
            \sigma_s(k) = \sum_{d|k} d^s \), where the sum is over all positive divisors of \( k \), and \( s \) is a
            number (real or complex). For \( s = 1 \), \( \sigma_1(6) = 1^1 + 2^1 + 3^1 + 6^1 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12 \).
            For \( s = 0 \), it’s just the number of divisors: \( \sigma_0(6) = 4 \). We’ll later use \( s \) as a
            negative number, like \( \sigma_{-s}(k) = \sum_{d|k} d^{-s} \).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Riemann Zeta Function</strong>: This function, \( \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-s} \) (for
            complex \( s \) where the real part \( \text{Re}(s) > 1 \)), sums over all positive integers and is key in
            studying prime numbers. Think of it as a grand tally that connects to how numbers factor into primes. We’ll
            draw parallels to a smaller sum over just the divisors of \( k \).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our goal is to link a trigonometric function to \( \sum_{d|k} d^{-s} \), a “divisor zeta function” that focuses
        on \( k \)’s divisors.</p>
</section>
<section id="function-y">
    <h2>3. The Function y(x) and Its Properties</h2>
    <p>Now, meet our star: \( y(x) = 2 - \cos(2\pi k x) - \cos(2\pi k / x) \), where \( k \) is a fixed positive
        integer, and \( x > 0 \) is a real number. This function oscillates due to the cosine terms, but it’s crafted to
        equal zero exactly when \( x \) is a divisor of \( k \).</p>
    <p>Why does this happen? Cosine equals 1 when its argument is a multiple of \( 2\pi \). If \( x = d \) and \( d \)
        divides \( k \), then:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\( k = d \cdot q \) for some integer \( q \).</li>
        <li>First term: \( 2\pi k x = 2\pi k d = 2\pi (d q) d = 2\pi q d^2 \), an integer times \( 2\pi \), so \(
            \cos(2\pi k d) = 1 \).
        </li>
        <li>Second term: \( 2\pi k / x = 2\pi k / d = 2\pi (d q) / d = 2\pi q \), also an integer times \( 2\pi \), so
            \( \cos(2\pi k / d) = 1 \).
        </li>
        <li>Thus, \( y(d) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0 \).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let’s test \( k = 6 \):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\( x = 1 \): \( y(1) = 2 - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 \cdot 1) - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 / 1) = 2 - \cos(12\pi) -
            \cos(12\pi) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0 \).
        </li>
        <li>\( x = 2 \): \( y(2) = 2 - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 \cdot 2) - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 / 2) = 2 - \cos(24\pi) -
            \cos(6\pi) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0 \).
        </li>
        <li>\( x = 3 \), \( x = 6 \): Similarly, both give 0.</li>
        <li>\( x = 4 \): \( y(4) = 2 - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 \cdot 4) - \cos(2\pi \cdot 6 / 4) = 2 - \cos(48\pi) -
            \cos(3\pi) = 2 - 1 - (-1) = 2 > 0 \), not a divisor.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, \( y(x) = 0 \) only at \( x = 1, 2, 3, 6 \), the divisors of 6. Elsewhere, \( y(x) > 0 \) because the cosines
        don’t align to subtract fully to 2.</p>
</section>
<section id="zeros">
    <h2>4. Zeros of y(x) and Their Significance</h2>
    <p>We’ve seen \( y(x) \) zeros out at divisors, but how “deep” are these zeros? Compute the derivative:</p>
    <p>\[ y'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} [2 - \cos(2\pi k x) - \cos(2\pi k / x)] = 2\pi k \sin(2\pi k x) + \frac{2\pi k}{x^2}
        \sin(2\pi k / x) \]</p>
    <p>At \( x = d \), a divisor:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\( \sin(2\pi k d) = \sin(\text{integer} \cdot 2\pi) = 0 \).</li>
        <li>\( \sin(2\pi k / d) = \sin(2\pi q) = 0 \).</li>
        <li>So, \( y'(d) = 0 \).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since \( y(d) = 0 \) and \( y'(d) = 0 \), each zero is at least double (like a parabola touching the x-axis). The
        second derivative:</p>
    <p>\[ y''(x) = (2\pi k)^2 \cos(2\pi k x) - \frac{4\pi k}{x^3} \sin(2\pi k / x) - \frac{(2\pi k)^2}{x^4} \cos(2\pi k
        / x) \]</p>
    <p>At \( x = d \), this simplifies to \( y''(d) = (2\pi k)^2 (1 - 1/d^4) \), which is positive for \( d > 1 \),
        confirming a double zero. This multiplicity will matter when we analyze \( y'(x)/y(x) \).</p>
</section>
<section id="contour-integrals">
    <h2>5. Contour Integrals and Residue Theory</h2>
    <p>Now we enter complex analysis. Extend \( y(x) \) to \( y(z) = 2 - \cos(2\pi k z) - \cos(2\pi k / z) \) for
        complex \( z \neq 0 \). It has zeros at \( z = d \) and \( z = -d \) for each divisor \( d \). The function \(
        \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} \) has poles at these zeros. Near a double zero \( z = d \), \( y(z) \approx c (z - d)^2 \),
        so:</p>
    <p>\[ y'(z) \approx 2c (z - d), \quad \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} \approx \frac{2c (z - d)}{c (z - d)^2} = \frac{2}{z - d}
        \]</p>
    <p>This has a simple pole at \( z = d \) with residue 2. The residue theorem says for a closed contour \( C \):</p>
    <p>\[ \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C f(z) \, dz = \text{sum of residues inside } C \]</p>
    <p>For \( f(z) = \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} z^{-s} \), each pole at \( z = d \) contributes residue \( 2 d^{-s} \).</p>
</section>
<section id="connecting">
    <h2>6. Connecting y(x) to the Divisor Zeta Function</h2>
    <p>Choose a contour \( C \) enclosing all positive divisors \( d \) (e.g., a curve along the real axis from \(
        \epsilon \) to a large \( R \), indented around zeros, and closed appropriately). The poles of \(
        \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} z^{-s} \) at \( z = d \) (positive \( d|k \)) give:</p>
    <p>\[ \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} z^{-s} \, dz = \sum_{d|k} 2 d^{-s} \]</p>
    <p>(Negative zeros are outside \( C \), and we assume other complex zeros don’t interfere, or their contribution
        cancels in a full contour.) This matches our target: \( 2 \sum_{d|k} d^{-s} \), a scaled divisor zeta function,
        linking \( y(x) \)’s zeros to \( k \)’s divisors analytically.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>We’ve built a bridge from a trigonometric function \( y(x) \) to the divisors of \( k \), showing its zeros
        pinpoint \( d|k \). Using complex analysis, we derived \( \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{y'(z)}{y(z)} z^{-s} \,
        dz = 2 \sum_{d|k} d^{-s} \), a powerful tool to detect divisors. This journey ties number theory to oscillatory
        behavior, offering both insight and a method to explore further.</p>

<section id="prompt">
    <h2>8. Re-Prompt</h2>

    <p class="code">
    Develop a mathematical method to detect the integer divisors of a given positive integer k by computing the sum Sum[d|k] d^(-s), where d are the positive divisors of k and s is a complex parameter, in a manner that resembles the structure of a Dirichlet series, such as the Riemann zeta function zeta(s) = Sum[n=1 to infinity] n^(-s). Use the function y(x) = 2 - cos(2 Pi k x) - cos(2 Pi k / x), which is known to equal zero exactly when x is an integer divisor of k (i.e., y(d) = 0 for d|k), as a key indicator of these divisors through its zeros. Your approach should:
Analyze y(x): Confirm that y(x) = 0 only at x = d where d is a positive integer divisor of k, and explore the nature of these zeros (e.g., their multiplicity) by computing derivatives.

Leverage Complex Analysis: Extend y(x) to a complex function y(z) and propose a contour integral involving y'(z)/y(z) or a similar logarithmic derivative, which has poles at the zeros of y(z), to extract information about the divisors.

Connect to a Dirichlet Series: Design the integral so that its evaluation (e.g., via the residue theorem) yields a sum proportional to Sum[d|k] d^(-s), linking the zeros of y(x) to a zeta-like structure.

Specify the Contour: Define a suitable contour in the complex plane that encloses the positive divisor zeros (e.g., z = d > 0) and justify its choice, addressing any challenges like oscillatory behavior or additional zeros.

Interpret the Result: Explain how the final expression detects divisors and relates to the broader context of number theory, such as the zeta function’s role in encoding arithmetic properties.

Provide a detailed derivation, including intermediate steps like computing residues, and conclude with a formula (e.g., a contour integral equaling 2 Sum[d|k] d^(-s)) that achieves this goal. Use examples (e.g., k = 6) to illustrate key points.
