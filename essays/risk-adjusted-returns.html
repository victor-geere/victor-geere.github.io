            <h2>Sharpe Ratio</h2>
            <p>The Sharpe Ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return, developed by William F. Sharpe. It helps investors understand how much excess return they are receiving for the extra volatility they endure by holding a riskier asset.</p>
            <h3>Formula</h3>
            <p>The Sharpe Ratio is calculated as follows:</p>
            \[ \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p} \]
            <p>where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( R_p \) is the expected portfolio return,</li>
                <li>\( R_f \) is the risk-free rate,</li>
                <li>\( \sigma_p \) is the standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Interpretation</h3>
            <p>A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates that the investment has a better risk-adjusted performance. For example, a Sharpe Ratio of 1 is considered acceptable, while a ratio of 2 is very good, and 3 or higher is excellent. Negative values indicate that the risk-free rate is higher than the portfolio's return, suggesting the investment is not compensating for the risk taken.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="calmar">
            <h2>Calmar Ratio</h2>
            <p>The Calmar Ratio is a performance measurement used to evaluate the return of an investment relative to its downside risk, specifically the maximum drawdown. It was developed by Terry W. Young in 1991 and is particularly popular among hedge fund managers.</p>
            <h3>Formula</h3>
            <p>The Calmar Ratio is calculated as follows:</p>
            \[ \text{Calmar Ratio} = \frac{\text{Annualized Return}}{\text{Maximum Drawdown}} \]
            <p>where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Annualized Return is the geometric average annual return of the investment,</li>
                <li>Maximum Drawdown is the maximum peak-to-trough decline in the investment's value over a specified period.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Interpretation</h3>
            <p>A higher Calmar Ratio indicates better performance relative to the downside risk. For instance, a Calmar Ratio above 1 suggests that the annualized return is greater than the maximum drawdown, which is desirable. Ratios below 1 indicate that the maximum drawdown exceeds the annualized return, signaling higher risk relative to return.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="sortino">
            <h2>Sortino Ratio</h2>
            <p>The Sortino Ratio is a variation of the Sharpe Ratio that differentiates harmful volatility from total overall volatility by using the downside deviation instead of the standard deviation. It was developed by Frank A. Sortino and is particularly useful for investors who are more concerned about downside risk.</p>
            <h3>Formula</h3>
            <p>The Sortino Ratio is calculated as follows:</p>
            \[ \text{Sortino Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_d} \]
            <p>where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( R_p \) is the expected portfolio return,</li>
                <li>\( R_f \) is the risk-free rate,</li>
                <li>\( \sigma_d \) is the downside deviation (standard deviation of negative asset returns).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Interpretation</h3>
            <p>Similar to the Sharpe Ratio, a higher Sortino Ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance, but with a focus on downside risk. A Sortino Ratio of 1 is considered good, while higher values are better. This ratio is particularly useful for comparing investments where downside risk is a primary concern.</p>

        <section id="alpha_beta">
            <h2>Alpha and Beta</h2>
            <p>Alpha and Beta are key metrics in portfolio management, providing insights into performance relative to a benchmark and exposure to market risk, respectively.</p>
            <h3>Definitions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alpha (\( \alpha \))</strong>: Measures the excess return of a portfolio compared to a benchmark, reflecting the value added or subtracted by a portfolio manager's decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Beta (\( \beta \))</strong>: Measures the sensitivity of a portfolio's returns to market movements. A beta of 1 means the portfolio moves in line with the market, greater than 1 indicates higher volatility, and less than 1 indicates lower volatility.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Interpretation with Sharpe, Calmar, and Sortino Ratios</h3>
            <p>Alpha and Beta enhance the understanding of the Sharpe, Calmar, and Sortino ratios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sharpe Ratio</strong>: This ratio assesses risk-adjusted returns using total volatility. A portfolio with high alpha (excess returns) and low beta (less market risk) typically has a higher Sharpe ratio, indicating superior performance per unit of risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Sortino Ratio</strong>: Focused on downside risk, the Sortino ratio benefits from high alpha and a low downside beta (sensitivity to market declines), resulting in a higher value, which reflects better returns relative to harmful volatility.</li>
                <li><strong>Calmar Ratio</strong>: This ratio compares annualized return to maximum drawdown. High alpha with a low maximum drawdown (often linked to lower beta) leads to a higher Calmar ratio, showing strong returns with limited downside risk.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Portfolio Risk vs. Excess Returns from Volatility (Volatility Harvesting)</h3>
            <p>Volatility harvesting involves strategies like rebalancing to exploit market volatility for excess returns. The Sharpe, Sortino, and Calmar ratios evaluate whether these returns justify the risks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sharpe Ratio</strong>: A high Sharpe ratio suggests that the excess returns from volatility harvesting outweigh the total volatility, indicating an efficient strategy.</li>
                <li><strong>Sortino Ratio</strong>: By focusing on downside volatility, a high Sortino ratio ensures the strategy generates excess returns without excessive negative fluctuations.</li>
                <li><strong>Calmar Ratio</strong>: A high Calmar ratio confirms that the strategy’s returns are robust compared to its worst-case loss, crucial for volatility-based approaches.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Alpha reflects the excess returns from these strategies beyond market performance, while beta shows the strategy’s market risk exposure. An effective volatility harvesting strategy might exhibit high alpha with a beta near 1, balancing excess returns with manageable market risk.</p>
            <h3>Alpha and Beta in View of Maximum Drawdown and Annualized Return</h3>
            <p>Alpha and Beta also inform portfolio performance in terms of maximum drawdown and annualized return:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alpha</strong>: High alpha indicates a portfolio outperforms its benchmark, contributing to higher annualized returns for the same level of market exposure.</li>
                <li><strong>Beta</strong>: Low beta reduces sensitivity to market swings, typically resulting in a lower maximum drawdown, as the portfolio experiences less severe declines.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A portfolio with high alpha and low beta is ideal, offering higher annualized returns with a smaller maximum drawdown. This combination enhances the Calmar ratio, as it maximizes returns relative to the largest loss experienced.</p>
