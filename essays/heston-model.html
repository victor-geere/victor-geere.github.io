    <h2 id="section1">1. Introduction to the Heston Model</h2>
    <p>The Heston model is a widely recognized stochastic volatility model in financial mathematics, primarily used for
        pricing options. Introduced by Steven Heston in his 1993 paper "A Closed-Form Solution for Options with
        Stochastic Volatility with Applications to Bond and Currency Options," it improves upon the Black-Scholes model
        by allowing volatility to vary over time rather than remaining constant. This feature makes it more aligned with
        real-world financial markets, where volatility is dynamic.</p>
    <p>Unlike the Black-Scholes model, which assumes a constant volatility and produces a flat implied volatility curve,
        the Heston model can replicate the "volatility smile"—a pattern where implied volatility changes with an
        option’s strike price. This capability stems from its stochastic volatility framework, making it especially
        valuable for pricing European options, which can only be exercised at expiration.</p>
</div>
<div>

    <h2 id="section2">2. Mathematical Formulation</h2>
    <p>The Heston model defines the dynamics of an asset price \( S_t \) and its variance \( v_t \) using two stochastic
        differential equations (SDEs) under the risk-neutral measure:</p>
    <div class="equation">
        \[ dS_t = r S_t \, dt + \sqrt{v_t} S_t \, dW_t^1 \]
    </div>
    <div class="equation">
        \[ dv_t = \kappa (\theta - v_t) \, dt + \sigma \sqrt{v_t} \, dW_t^2 \]
    </div>
    <p>Here, the variables and parameters are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\( S_t \): Asset price at time \( t \)</li>
        <li>\( v_t \): Instantaneous variance at time \( t \)</li>
        <li>\( r \): Risk-free interest rate</li>
        <li>\( \kappa \): Rate of mean reversion of the variance</li>
        <li>\( \theta \): Long-term mean variance</li>
        <li>\( \sigma \): Volatility of the variance</li>
        <li>\( W_t^1, W_t^2 \): Wiener processes with correlation \( \rho \), where \( dW_t^1 \, dW_t^2 = \rho \, dt
            \)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The asset price follows a geometric Brownian motion with stochastic volatility \( \sqrt{v_t} \), while the
        variance follows a mean-reverting square root process (Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process), ensuring non-negativity if
        \( 2 \kappa \theta > \sigma^2 \) (the Feller condition). The correlation \( \rho \) often reflects the leverage
        effect, typically negative in equity markets, where falling prices increase volatility.</p>
</div>
<div>

    <h2 id="section3">3. Option Pricing in the Heston Model</h2>
    <p>A major strength of the Heston model is its semi-closed form solution for European option prices, derived using
        the characteristic function of the log asset price. For a European call option with strike price \( K \) and
        maturity \( T \), the price \( C \) is:</p>
    <div class="equation">
        \[ C = S_0 e^{-q T} P_1 - K e^{-r T} P_2 \]
    </div>
    <p>where \( q \) is the dividend yield, and \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) are probabilities computed via:</p>
    <div class="equation">
        \[ P_j = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^\infty \text{Re} \left( \frac{e^{-i \phi \ln K} f_j(\phi)}{i \phi}
        \right) d\phi, \quad j = 1, 2 \]
    </div>
    <p>Here, \( f_j(\phi) \) are the characteristic functions, and numerical integration makes this practical. For
        complex options (e.g., American or exotic), numerical methods like Monte Carlo simulation or finite difference
        methods are typically required.</p>
</div>
<div>

    <h2 id="section4">4. Implementing the Heston Model in Python</h2>
    <p>A practical Python implementation of the Heston model is available on GitHub at <a
            href="https://github.com/Pauli-Isosomppi/Heston-model">https://github.com/Pauli-Isosomppi/Heston-model</a>.
        This repository offers code to price options, likely using the characteristic function method for European
        options. Users can specify parameters such as \( \kappa, \theta, \sigma, \rho, v_0 \) (initial variance), \( S_0
        \), \( K \), \( T \), and \( r \) to compute option prices, making it a useful resource for both learning and
        application.</p>
</div>
<div>

    <h2 id="section5">5. Calibration of the Heston Model</h2>
    <p>To apply the Heston model, its parameters must be calibrated to market data, such as observed option prices. This
        involves solving an optimization problem to minimize the difference (e.g., squared errors) between model and
        market prices. Due to the model’s nonlinearity and potential for multiple local minima, global optimization
        methods like genetic algorithms or simulated annealing are often employed.</p>
</div>
<div>

    <h2 id="section6">6. Applications and Limitations</h2>
    <p>The Heston model is prevalent in equity and forex markets for pricing European options, excelling at capturing
        the volatility smile. Its advantages include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Analytical Tractability**: Efficient semi-closed form solutions</li>
        <li>**Flexibility**: Adjustable parameters for various smile patterns</li>
        <li>**Realism**: Stochastic volatility aligns with market behavior</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Assumptions**: No price or volatility jumps</li>
        <li>**Calibration Complexity**: Computationally intensive</li>
        <li>**Scope**: Less efficient for non-European options</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2 id="section7">7. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The Heston model enhances option pricing by incorporating stochastic volatility, offering a robust alternative to
        the Black-Scholes model. With tools like the GitHub implementation, it remains a vital resource for financial
        professionals and researchers.</p>
