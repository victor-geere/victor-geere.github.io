  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>This text analyzes the relationship between discrete and continuous mathematical models. It examines the binomial lattice as a discrete framework and its transition to continuous-time systems, including stochastic processes and compound interest. The analysis employs exponential functions such as \(2^x\) and \(e^x\), and considers the summation of actions defined by \(f(S, a)\), where \(a = \frac{1}{S \cdot \epsilon}\) represents exposure size inversely proportional to price, with \(\epsilon\) a constant. These sums are related to integrals, and Malliavin calculus is introduced. The material targets readers with a mathematical background.</p>

  <h2>2. The Binomial Lattice Model</h2>
  <p>The binomial lattice is a discrete-time model for processes such as asset pricing. Given an initial value \(S_0\), at each time step, the value increases by a factor \(u\) with probability \(p\) or decreases by a factor \(d\) with probability \(1-p\). After \(k\) steps, the value at a node with \(j\) upward moves is \(S_{k,j} = S_0 u^j d^{k-j}\). This model provides a framework for evaluating probabilistic outcomes over discrete intervals.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="summing-actions">
  <h2>3. Summation of Actions on the Lattice</h2>
  <p>An action is defined by a function \(f(S_{k,j}, a)\), where \(a = \frac{1}{S_{k,j} \cdot \epsilon}\) is the exposure size, inversely proportional to the node value \(S_{k,j}\), and \(\epsilon\) is a positive constant. The sum of actions at time \(k\) is \(\sum_{j=0}^k f(S_0 u^j d^{k-j}, \frac{1}{S_0 u^j d^{k-j} \cdot \epsilon}) \binom{k}{j} p^j (1-p)^{k-j}\). For a lattice over \(n\) steps, the total sum is the double summation across all time steps up to \(n\). This formulation represents the aggregate effect of exposure-adjusted actions, weighted by binomial probabilities.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="closed-form">
  <h2>4. Closed-Form Expressions</h2>
  <p>Closed-form expressions for the lattice sums are derived based on the form of \(f(S, a)\). Consider \(f(S, a) = S \cdot a = S \cdot \frac{1}{S \cdot \epsilon} = \frac{1}{\epsilon}\), a constant. The sum at time \(k\) simplifies to \(\sum_{j=0}^k \frac{1}{\epsilon} \binom{k}{j} p^j (1-p)^{k-j} = \frac{1}{\epsilon} (p + 1 - p)^k = \frac{1}{\epsilon}\). The total sum over \(n\) steps is \(\sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{\epsilon} = \frac{n + 1}{\epsilon}\). For other forms, such as \(f(S, a) = e^{a S}\), the sum involves the moment-generating function, yielding a geometric series dependent on \(u\), \(d\), and \(p\). These expressions compactly represent the latticeâ€™s behavior.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="continuous-limit">
  <h2>5. Continuous-Time Limits and Compound Interest</h2>
  <p>As \(n\) increases and the time step decreases, the binomial lattice converges to a continuous-time process, such as geometric Brownian motion in the Black-Scholes model. With \(u = e^{\sigma \sqrt{t}}\) and \(d = e^{-\sigma \sqrt{t}}\), the discrete sum for \(f(S, a) = \frac{1}{\epsilon}\) over time approximates a continuous integral. For a related form like \(f(S) = S\), the sum \(S_0 \frac{e^{r T} - 1}{r}\) corresponds to \(\int_0^T S_0 e^{r t} \, dt\), reflecting continuous compounding at rate \(r\) over time \(T\). This illustrates the discrete-to-continuous transition.</p>

<div class="section" id="malliavin">
  <h2>6. Malliavin Calculus and Stochastic Integrals</h2>
  <p>In continuous time, asset values follow stochastic processes, such as \(S_t = S_0 e^{\left(r - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)t + \sigma W_t}\), where \(W_t\) is Brownian motion. The action function becomes \(f(S_t, a_t)\), with \(a_t = \frac{1}{S_t \cdot \epsilon}\), and the lattice sum transitions to \(\int_0^T f(S_t, \frac{1}{S_t \cdot \epsilon}) \, dt\). For \(f(S_t, a_t) = \frac{1}{\epsilon}\), the integral is \(\int_0^T \frac{1}{\epsilon} \, dt = \frac{T}{\epsilon}\). Malliavin calculus analyzes the differentiability of \(S_t\), aiding in sensitivity calculations (e.g., option Greeks), enhancing the continuous-time framework.</p>

<div class="section" id="conclusion">
  <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This text details the progression from discrete binomial lattices to continuous-time models. It shows how exponential functions (\(2^x\) in discrete time, \(e^{r t}\) in continuous time) and their summations or integrals, adjusted by exposure size \(a = \frac{1}{S \cdot \epsilon}\), connect these domains. Stochastic processes and Malliavin calculus further link finite and infinite systems. This analysis provides a basis for advanced study in mathematics and financial modeling.</p>
