<!-- Life Principles -->
<div class="section" id="life-principles">
    <h2>Life Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Embrace Reality and Deal with It</strong><br>
            Accept the world as it is, not as you wish it to be. Truth is the foundation for progress, requiring you to face weaknesses and mistakes honestly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Use the 5-Step Process</strong><br>
            Achieve goals by: (1) setting clear goals, (2) identifying problems, (3) diagnosing root causes, (4) designing solutions, and (5) executing. Iterate relentlessly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Be Radically Open-Minded</strong><br>
            Challenge your beliefs, seek diverse perspectives, and let go of ego to uncover better solutions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Understand Your Strengths and Weaknesses</strong><br>
            Know yourself deeply—what you excel at and where you need help—then build support systems to compensate.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Learn from Pain</strong><br>
            View mistakes and setbacks as teachers. Pain plus reflection equals progress.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<!-- Work Principles -->
<div class="section" id="work-principles">
    <h2>Work Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Radical Truth and Transparency</strong><br>
            Create a culture where honesty thrives—no sugarcoating, no hidden agendas. Open critique drives improvement.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Idea Meritocracy</strong><br>
            Let the best ideas win, based on evidence and reasoning, not rank or politics.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Systemize Decision-Making</strong><br>
            Turn insights into repeatable processes or algorithms to ensure consistency and scalability.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Build Strong Teams</strong><br>
            Hire people who complement your weaknesses, share your mission, and uphold high standards.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Manage as a Machine</strong><br>
            Treat organizations as systems with inputs and outputs. Refine the "machine" continuously for better results.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<!-- Conclusion -->
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Dalio’s *Principles* are a call to embrace reality, learn iteratively, and build systems—whether for personal growth or leading teams. Rooted in his view of life as an evolutionary process, they encourage hyper-realism and adaptability. These ideas aren’t dogma but a toolkit: test them, tweak them, and make them your own.
